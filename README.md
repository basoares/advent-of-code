[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) set of problems using various programming languages.

After completing the 2018 edition, I started solving the problems for the previous years. Below are the links to the solutions for the different programming languages and challenges.
